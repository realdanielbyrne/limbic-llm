# Evolution lab notebook

This is an AlphaEvolve-style search over the side channels: propose changes, score them on the GPUs, keep the best.
A human checkpoint follows every round. Each entry records what was tried, the scores, the winning diff, any surprises, and the proposed next step.
Round 0 is the current code (`limbic_llm/temporal_loop.py`, `experiments/pretrained_loop.py`) as it stood at commit `b39abab`.
The project's history is in [`docs/genesis.md`](../../docs/genesis.md).

## Fitness (agreed 1 Nov 2026)

1. **Reach.** Recall the needle on Qwen3-1.7B-Base with every layer windowed (gap about 500 tokens). Score digit cross-entropy against the answer-format floor, 0.8·ln10 = 1.842. Exact match is a secondary score.
2. **Stability (must pass).** The closed-loop echo stays bounded on `experiments/temporal_loop.py --suite stability`. The reference is genesis §6: 0.27–0.35 of input, peak 0.53.
3. **New tokens dominate (must pass).** Zero-shot recency probe. The full design names the older event 18% of the time.

Candidates must also satisfy the anti-gaming rules E1–E9 in [`round0_plan.md`](round0_plan.md) §3: strict causality, bounded state, a parameter budget, input isolation, and held-out gaps.

## Round 0: diagnosis (1 Nov 2026)

**Method.** A workflow of 21 agents examined the problem from four angles: gradient flow, memory capacity, Qwen3 against Qwen3.5, and task mechanics. Each hypothesis was checked by an adversarial verifier, using code reading and CPU checks only. The full output is in [`round0_plan.md`](round0_plan.md).

**Findings**
- **D1 (fact).** Qwen3 windowed+side scores exactly the answer-format floor. Eval loss is 1.8421 against 0.8·ln10 = 1.8421, and digit accuracy is at chance. The side channels learned the leading space and the digit distribution, and nothing about the value.
- **D2 (main suspect).** The default `osc` kernel with ρ 0.7 and τ 16 gives the needle a weight of about 2e-5 against a row mass of 14.7. On some digit diagonals the weight is exactly 0. The needle's key gradient is about 5e-6.
- **D3 (open).** The contrast prior is an unweighted mean, so it sends a needle share of about 3–4.5% whatever the gap, yet nothing arrives. Something downstream may also block the value: tap-14 states may not encode it, or the frozen windowed upper layers may ignore a small component.
- **D4.** Qwen3.5's attention-only exact 1.0 is carried by the intact Gated DeltaNet layers, not by the loop's retrieval. The tap-22 result points to the layers above the tap.
- **D5.** The pre-fix all-windowed loss drift (1.69) was an **anti-causal leak**, not real transfer. `arange(512)` in bf16 has only 385 distinct values, so the `d>=0` mask let some predictions see their own targets. The fp32 fix removes it.

**Refuted:** read sharpness, contrast, or the CA1 gate as the bottleneck; "the loop structurally cannot reach the needle" (a CPU check reached 97% with the value spread over block 0).

**Round-0 diagnostic runs** (existing flags only, 1000 steps each, about 3.5 minutes per run). Pass means loss ≤ 1.82 and token_acc ≥ 0.315.
- The horizon runs Daniel requested (`--kernel exp --rho 0.95 --tau 32`, weight 0.47 at 500) answer D2 against D3 and stand in for arm g2.
- The remaining arms, which depend on that answer: g1 `flat`, g3 `flat --no-time`, g4 `flat --no-contrast`, g5 `flat --pairs 2`, g6/g7 `flat` at tap 6 and 22.

**Decision needed at this checkpoint.** Rule E2 (state size fixed regardless of sequence length) rules out the current `HippocampalLoop` itself, which keeps every past `x_pre` and so is O(T). The design doc says the kernel has an O(1) recurrent form, but the content-addressed relevance exp(b(q·k−1)) does not. Should round 1 require a fixed-size state, which leads to Gated DeltaNet or φ-feature loops, or allow the O(T) loop as in the design?
